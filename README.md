# EchoBot

EchoBot application example from [line-bot-sdk-go](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-go/blob/master/examples/echo_bot/server.go) port to
Elixir.

## Experiment Goals

1. I want to know how hard to implements LINE webhook api on a new language (new language means no sdk from LINE official repository).
2. Learn Elixir, so much fun!!
3. Can we make it as a data ingession? This idea come from [Broadway](https://hexdocs.pm/broadway/Broadway.html). I didn't try it yet.
